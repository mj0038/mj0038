# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mridul Jhawar (MJ)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! It's a little digital garden where I sow seeds of code and grow projects that stem from my passion for technology, data science, and the endless possibilities that arise at the intersection of both.

## About Me ðŸŒ±


Transitioning from the structured world of biochemistry to the dynamic realm of data science wasn't just a career shift for me; it was a leap into a new dimension where I can experiment, learn, and grow endlessly. Just as complex networks of cells and biochemical pathways underpin the functions of living organisms, neural networks form the core of modern AI, enabling machines to learn from data. This incredible resonance between life and algorithms fuels my passion for exploring and pushing the frontiers of technology and data science.

Armed with a minor in Statistics and Mathematics, I have a profound appreciation for the underpinnings of data scienceâ€”quantitative research. This strong foundation equips me with the analytical rigor and precision necessary to delve deep into data, uncover patterns, and derive meaningful insights that drive innovation. Whether it's through sophisticated statistical models or advanced machine learning algorithms, my goal is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge.

Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in the captivating realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and am actively working on refining Dialogue GPT models for movie data. My goal? To harness the power of AI in a way that mirrors the complexity and nuance of human communication.

But my interests don't stop there. I'm dipping my toes into the vast ocean of web development, learning how to weave the web more intricately and beautifully.
